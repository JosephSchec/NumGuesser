# First attempt at GoLang!

### Simple number guesser game with Go's built in scanner

Things I learned:

- `go mod init` should be from Project Level
- `go mod tidy` adds/removes any missing dependancies to mod file
- `go build` easily creates an exe file
- how to import packages in Go
- How to use basic loop, declerations and pointers in Go
